Welcome to Sophia's Snake Game!

This game is a new twist on the traditional snake game. You play as a hungry snake in a forest, trying to eat candy or other delicious food while avoiding obstacles. Your goal is to reach a score of 20 within 60 seconds.



RULES:

1.Blue rectangle: This represents the food that you can eat. Each time you touch the ends of the square, you will add 1 point to your total score.
2.Red rectangle: This is an obstacle that you should avoid. If you hit it, you will lose 1 point from your score.
3.Green Snake Square: This represents you as the snake in the game. You can move it using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to make any movement you want.
4.Do not touch the end of the screen or you will die and lose the game!


How to win:
Score 20 points within 60 seconds. The scoreboard is located at the top left, and the timer is at the top right. (Fun fact: the author has already tested the game and achieved 20 points without hitting any obstacles in about 45 seconds. Keep going and set a new record!)



When you lose:

1.You touch the end of the screen.
2.You fail to get 20 points in 60 seconds.
